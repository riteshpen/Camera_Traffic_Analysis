# 📊 SHAP Visualization Note

The SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations) visualizations generated by our
analysis **cannot be displayed directly in GitHub preview** due to their interactive nature. 
The SHAP plot visualizes how a model's prediction is affected by a specific feature. 
The larger the spread means that feature has a larger influence on the model's prediction. 
Positive SHAP values push the model's average prediction up and vice versa. 

## 🔍 Viewing the Visualizations

### Option 1: Run the Code Locally
The most reliable way to view the SHAP plots is to run the code yourself:

```
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repo-name.git
cd repo-name

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Additional packages for SHAP visualization (if not in requirements.txt)
pip install shap matplotlib seaborn ipywidgets jupyter
```
### Option 2: View Static Screenshots

We've included static PNG exports of the key SHAP plots in the Visuals folder:
- newplot (10).png - SHAP plot taking into account the magnitude
- newplot (11).png - SHAP Feature Dependence Plot - SHAP plot taken into account of magnitude and direction  
- newplot(5).png - Comparison between Ridge Regression and Random Forest on R² and RMSE
