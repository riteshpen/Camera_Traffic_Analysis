# 📊 SHAP Visualization Note

The SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations) visualizations generated by our
analysis **cannot be displayed directly in GitHub preview** due to their interactive nature.

## 🔍 Viewing the Visualizations

### Option 1: Run the Code Locally
The most reliable way to view the SHAP plots is to run the code yourself:

```
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repo-name.git
cd repo-name

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the SHAP visualization script
python scripts/shap_analysis.py
# or open the Jupyter notebook
jupyter notebook notebooks/shap_analysis.ipynb
```
### Option 2: View Static Screenshots

We've included static PNG exports of the key SHAP plots in the Visuals folder:
- newplot (10).png - 
- newplot (11).png
- newplot(5).png - Comparison between Ridge Regression and Random Forest on R² and RMSE.
